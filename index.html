            <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

                Web Development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves using different programming languages
                like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as working with a variety of frameworks and tools to build everything from simple webpages to complex 
                e-commerce sites and social networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web Development consists of three key aspects. These include: front-end development, back-end development and full-stack development. 
                Front-end development referes to the "client-facing" side of web development. It focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). 
                Back-end development refers to the "server-facing" side of web development that powers the website. It deals with databases, logic, and APIs  
                to ensure the application functions correctly behind the scenes. Lastly, Full-stack development is where developers are familiar with both 
                front- and back-end development, allowing them to manage the entire web development process.

            <h2>Future of Web Development</h2>

            <p>
                As technology continues to grow rapidly, the future of web development is changing the way we build and design websites. Therefore, developers and 
                businesses need to keep up with new tools, technology, frameworks, and innovations. Some trends include: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML),
                Voice and Gesture-Based Interfaces, Cybersecurity and many more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, AI tools like (ChatGPT and Copilot) help developers with repetitive tasks and writing codes faster. It also enhances user experiences, automate tasks and optimize
                website performance. Secondly, the increasing use of voice assistants and gesture-controlled devices is due to the demand of more natural, accessible and hands-free 
                digital interactions. As a result, this would help boost user experience by making websites more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities and enabling 
                multitasking. Thirdly, with the rise of cyber threats, web developers must implement robust security systems and measures like multi-factor authentication and secure
                data handling to protect its users from harm and comply with data privacy laws.
